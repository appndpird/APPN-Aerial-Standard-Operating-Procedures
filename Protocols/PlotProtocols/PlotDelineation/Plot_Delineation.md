# APPN – Plot Delineation

> [!WARNING]
> **Draft document — large sections require discussion with the APPN
> Field EWG.** Several parts of this protocol (including the recommended
> buffer values, the mandatory shapefile attribute set, and the trial
> information join specification) are placeholders intended to show the
> structure and intent of the standard. They must be reviewed and

> Sections requiring EWG input are flagged inline with `IMPORTANT`
> callouts.

This protocol defines the APPN standard for plot delineation shapefiles —
their structure, attributes, and storage location within the APPN folder
hierarchy — and documents the supported methods for producing them from
APPN aerial imagery (typically RGB orthomosaics captured by GRYFN UAV
systems). Consistent plot delineation underpins repeatable phenotypic
analysis across APPN trials.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The APPN plot shapefile specification below must be followed for all
> trials, regardless of which method is used to generate the shapefile.
> For any deviations from this specification or these methods (e.g.
> alternative tools, non-standard plot layouts), keep detailed records of
> the changes made, the rationale, and any implications for downstream

## Document Structure

This protocol is organised so you can read it top-to-bottom for the full
APPN plot delineation standard, or jump straight to the section you need:

- [APPN Plot Delineation](#appn-plot-delineation) — rationale and the
  competing sources of error a standard delineation approach must manage.
  - [Recommended Buffer](#recommended-buffer) — default inward buffer
    values, worked examples, and when to deviate.
- [APPN Plot Shapefile Standard](#appn-plot-shapefile-standard) — the
  mandatory file format, attributes, storage location, and naming
  convention every plot shapefile must follow.
  - [File format](#file-format)
  - [Required attributes](#required-attributes)
  - [Storage location](#storage-location)
  - [File naming convention](#file-naming-convention)
- [Joining Trial Information](#joining-trial-information) — how trial
  metadata is attached to the plot geometry via `plot_id`.
- [Methods](#methods) — supported procedures for generating an
  APPN-compliant plot shapefile.

## APPN Plot Delineation

A standard APPN plot delineation approach ensures that comparable trials can
be analysed consistently across nodes. The goal is to maximise the usable
plot area sampled by the aerial data while minimising two competing sources
of error:

- **Edge effects** — agronomic and radiometric contamination from
  neighbouring plots, alleys, and bare soil at plot boundaries.
- **Positional uncertainty** — small misalignments between the plot
  shapefile and the orthomosaic caused by GNSS/RTK error, orthorectification
  residuals, and sowing/layout drift (rows bowing or skewing relative to
  the design grid as the seeder tracks across the trial).

In practice, this is achieved by applying a consistent inward **buffer** to
each plot polygon so the analysed region sits comfortably inside the true
plot extent, regardless of which method is used to generate the shapefile.

### Recommended Buffer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The buffer values, worked examples, and guidance in this section are
> **placeholders** derived from a quick literature scan. They are included
> to demonstrate the intended formatting and layout of this section and
> **must not be treated as the APPN standard** until reviewed and approved
> by the APPN Field EWG. The agreed-upon values will replace the numbers
> shown here.

To keep results comparable across nodes, APPN trials should apply a
consistent inward buffer to every plot polygon. The default rule is:

> [!NOTE]
> **APPN default buffer:** 0.3 m from each plot end and 0.2 m from each 
> plot side (across the drill direction), **or** 15% of the corresponding 
> plot dimension — whichever is larger.

The buffer used must be recorded in the tool-specific configuration saved
alongside the shapefile (e.g. the FIELDimageR JSON) so the layout can be
reproduced.

#### Worked examples

| Plot size (L × W)              | Buffer (end / side) | Analysis area (L × W)   | % of plot |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| 6 m × 2 m (cereal yield plot)  | 0.5 m / 0.25 m      | 5.0 m × 1.5 m           | ~63%      |
| 4 m × 1.5 m (small breeding)   | 0.3 m / 0.2 m       | 3.4 m × 1.1 m           | ~62%      |
| 2 m × 1 m (micro-plot)         | 0.2 m / 0.15 m      | 1.6 m × 0.7 m           | ~56%      |
| 10 m × 3 m (agronomy strip)    | 1.0 m / 0.5 m       | 8.0 m × 2.0 m           | ~53%      |

#### When to increase the buffer

- Coarser GSD (e.g. hyperspectral at ~5 cm vs RGB at ~1 cm).
- Tall or lodging-prone canopies where canopy lean shifts the visible plot
  off its sown footprint.
- Narrow alleys (<0.5 m) where neighbouring canopies merge.
- Trials without RTK GNSS or without ground control points (GCPs) in the
  orthomosaic.

#### When a smaller buffer may be acceptable

- RTK-georeferenced GCPs present in the orthomosaic.
- Wide alleys with bare inter-row visible between plots.

> [!NOTE]
> Any deviation from the default buffer must be recorded with the trial's
> plot layout files and justified in the trial notes.

## APPN Plot Shapefile Standard

All APPN plot shapefiles must conform to the following standard so that
downstream pipelines can ingest them without trial-specific configuration.

### File format

- **Primary format:** ESRI Shapefile (`.shp` plus its sidecar files
  `.shx`, `.dbf`, `.prj`, `.cpg`). All sidecar files must be kept
  together with the `.shp`.
- **CRS:** the CRS of the source orthomosaic (typically the correct zone of GDA2020). 
  The `.prj` file must be present and correct.
- **Geometry:** one polygon per plot. Polygons should be rectangular and
  aligned to the trial layout, sized to the plot dimensions minus the
  inward buffer applied to mitigate edge effects.
- **Backup copy:** an additional copy of the same layer must be saved in
  an open, plain-text format — **GeoJSON** (`.geojson`) is preferred —
  using the **same base file name** as the shapefile (e.g.
  `MyTrial_plots.shp` → `MyTrial_plots.geojson`) and stored alongside it.
  This guards against shapefile-specific limitations (10-character field
  names, 2 GB size cap, missing sidecars) and makes the layer
  diff-friendly in version control.

### Required attributes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The exact set of **mandatory** attribute columns is still **to be agreed
> by the APPN Field EWG**. The lists below are placeholders showing the
> intended structure and the kinds of columns under consideration; they
> must not be treated as the final standard until ratified.

Each plot polygon should carry, at minimum:

- `fid` — unique polygon identifier assigned by the delineation tool
  (e.g. FIELDimageR's sequential `fid`). It identifies the *geometry*
  only and may not match the trial's plot numbering.
- `plot_id` — plot number from the trial design / sowing plan. This is
  the **join key** used to attach trial metadata to the geometry (see
  [Joining Trial Information](#joining-trial-information)).

> [!NOTE]
> `fid` and `plot_id` must be kept as **separate columns**. `fid` is the
> tool's internal polygon ID; `plot_id` is the agronomic plot number from
> the trial design. Conflating the two breaks reproducibility when the
> shapefile is regenerated and `fid` values shift.

#### Candidate mandatory plot-identification columns

Used to locate a plot within the trial layout:

- `range` — range (column) index in the trial design.
- `row` — row index in the trial design.
- `block` / `replicate` — replication block identifier.
- `is_buffer_plot` — Boolean flag (`True`/`False`) marking *buffer plots*
  (filler / border plots sown around the trial edge to absorb edge
  effects). These polygons are still delimited so they can be visualised
  and excluded from analysis, but they carry no experimental treatment.
  Not to be confused with the inward analysis **buffer** applied to
  every plot polygon (see [Recommended Buffer](#recommended-buffer)).

(`plot_id` is listed above as part of the minimum set, since it is the
join key.)

#### Candidate mandatory biological / treatment columns

Used to describe what is in the plot:

- `crop` — crop type (e.g. *Wheat*).
- `species` — crop species (e.g. *Triticum aestivum*).
- `genotype` / `entry` — variety, line, or accession code.
- `treatment` — agronomic or experimental treatment applied to the plot.

#### Candidate provenance columns

Used to trace how the polygon was produced:

- `method` — delineation method (e.g. `FIELDimageR`).
- `buffer_end_m`, `buffer_side_m` — buffer values applied (in metres).
- `source_ortho` — filename or ID of the orthomosaic the polygon was fit to.
- `created` — ISO date the shapefile was generated.

> [!NOTE]
> The columns required to **join trial information** from the trial
> spreadsheet are still to be defined. At a minimum, the shapefile and
> the spreadsheet must share `plot_id` so that the join described in
> [Joining Trial Information](#joining-trial-information) can be
> performed reliably. `fid` should not be used as the join key — it is
> tool-assigned and may change when the shapefile is regenerated. 

### Storage location

Save the shapefile (and all sidecar files) in the site-level
`Documentation/Plot_Layout/` directory under the APPN folder structure (see
the [APPN folder structure wiki](https://github.com/ArdenB/APPN_GenricFileStorage/wiki/Folder-Structure)
for the full naming convention).

Formal path:

```
{Node}/
  {YYYY_ProjectDesc[_I|E][_Researcher][_org]}/
  {YYYYSiteName[_F|C]}/Documentation/Plot_Layout/
```

Example:

```
USYD_Narrabri/2025_SIFOzBarley/2025IAWatson_F/Documentation/Plot_Layout/
```

Also save the tool-specific configuration used to generate the shapefile
(e.g. the FIELDimageR JSON settings) alongside it so the layout can be
reproduced.

### File naming convention

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The file naming convention below is a **placeholder** and is **subject
> to APPN Field EWG discussion and approval**. It is provided to show the
> intended structure (site identifier + role suffix + revision) and the
> kinds of role suffixes that may be needed; the final scheme will
> replace what is shown here. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> THESE NAMES SUCK. 
> TO DO: GET TAM, CONNOR AND RICHARD TO HELP REDSIGN THIS COMPLETLY


A site's `Plot_Layout/` directory may contain more than one plot
shapefile — for example, the main analysis layout plus one or more
exclusion layers covering areas affected by destructive field
interventions (biomass cuts, manual sampling quadrats, damaged plots,
etc.). A consistent naming convention keeps these distinguishable.

Proposed format:

```
{YYYYSiteName}_{role}[_v{NN}].{ext}
```

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `{YYYYSiteName}` | Site identifier (year + site name), matching the parent folder name with the `_F` suffix dropped. Plot layouts only apply to field sites. |
| `{role}` | Short role tag describing what the layer represents (see below). |
| `_v{NN}` | Optional zero-padded revision (`_v01`, `_v02`, …). Bump on any change to geometry or attributes. |
| `{ext}` | `shp` (with sidecars) and `geojson` for the backup copy. |

Proposed role tags:

- `plots` — the primary analysis layout (one polygon per plot, buffer
  applied per the [APPN Plot Shapefile Standard](#appn-plot-shapefile-standard)).
- `plots_raw` — unbuffered or pre-buffer plot footprints, if retained.
- `exclude_biomass` — areas removed for biomass cuts.
- `exclude_sampling` — areas removed for other destructive sampling
  (manual quadrats, soil cores, etc.).
- `exclude_damage` — plots or sub-areas excluded due to damage,
  lodging, weed pressure, or other quality issues.
- `gcp` — ground control point locations, if stored alongside the
  layout.

Examples (within
`USYD_Narrabri/2025_SIFOzBarley/2025IAWatson_F/Documentation/Plot_Layout/`):

```
2025IAWatson_plots_v01.shp           (+ .shx .dbf .prj .cpg)
2025IAWatson_plots_v01.geojson
2025IAWatson_plots_v01.json          (FIELDimageR settings)
2025IAWatson_exclude_biomass_v01.shp
2025IAWatson_exclude_biomass_v01.geojson
```

> [!NOTE]
> Exclusion layers should use the **same CRS and `plot_id` scheme** as
> the primary `plots` layer so that downstream pipelines can spatially
> subtract or flag affected plots without additional configuration.

## Joining Trial Information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TODO / TBD — pending APPN Field EWG approval.**
> The trial information spreadsheet specification (mandatory columns,
> file format, naming convention, and storage location) and the
> end-to-end procedure for joining it onto the plot shapefile are still
> to be defined. The placeholder workflow below illustrates the intended
> approach using `plot_id` as the join key, but is **not** the ratified
> APPN standard.
>
> Open questions for the EWG include:
>
> - Required vs. optional columns in the trial spreadsheet (e.g. `plot_id`,
>   `range`, `row`, `block`/`replicate`, `crop`, `species`, `genotype`,
>   `treatment`).
> - Preferred file format (`.csv` vs `.xlsx`) and naming convention.
> - Where the trial spreadsheet lives in the APPN folder structure
>   (likely under `Documentation/`).
> - Whether the join should be performed once at trial setup, or
>   re-applied each time the shapefile is regenerated.
> - Whether the joined output should overwrite the source shapefile or
>   be saved as a separate `*_joined.shp`.

Most delineation tools produce a shapefile whose plots are identified
by a tool-assigned `fid` plus the design's `plot_id`. Trial metadata is
attached as a separate step using `plot_id` as the join key:

1. Prepare a spreadsheet (CSV or XLSX) of trial information with one row
   per plot and a `plot_id` column whose values match the shapefile's
   `plot_id`.
2. In QGIS, load both layers and use **Properties → Joins** on the
   shapefile to join the spreadsheet on the `plot_id` field. Do not use
   `fid` as the join key — it is tool-assigned and may change when the
   shapefile is regenerated.
3. Export the joined layer back to a shapefile in the same `Plot_Layout`
   directory so the trial metadata is persisted in the `.dbf`.

## Methods

The following methods are supported for generating an APPN-compliant plot
shapefile. Choose the method that best matches your imagery and tooling;
the resulting shapefile must satisfy the
[APPN Plot Shapefile Standard](#appn-plot-shapefile-standard) above.

- [Method 1: FIELDimageR (QGIS)](#method-1-fieldimager-qgis)
- *(Additional methods to be added.)*

---

## Method 1: FIELDimageR (QGIS)

FIELDimageR is an R-based plugin run from within QGIS that builds plot
polygons from a georeferenced orthomosaic.

![FIELDimageR functions installed in the R scripts folder](Plot_Delineation_media/image_37f8400f36f7.jpg)

### Generating the Plot Shapefile

With FIELDimageR set up, you can now generate plot shapefiles from your
aerial imagery.

1. Load an image into QGIS. An RGB orthomosaic from a GRYFN drone is the
   easiest starting point.

   ![Loaded RGB orthomosaic in QGIS](Plot_Delineation_media/image_d29caa3b45af.png)

2. Open the **fieldShape** module from the Processing Toolbox.

   ![Opening the fieldShape module](Plot_Delineation_media/image_c9dce09dde41.png)

3. Fill in the module parameters:
   - Number of **rows** and **columns**.
   - The **corners** of the trial area (most critical for an accurate
     fit).
   - **Plot size**.
   - **Buffer** — essential for establishing a common analysis area by
     mitigating edge effects.

4. Click **Run**.

   ![Run button in the fieldShape module](Plot_Delineation_media/image_866350342e31.png)

5. The plot shapefile will be generated.

> [!NOTE]
> Achieving a perfect fit usually takes some iteration on the corner
> coordinates. (_TODO: improve this workflow._)

#### Save your settings

Save your fieldShape settings before closing the tool — inputs will be
wiped if FIELDimageR is closed.

![Saving fieldShape settings as JSON](Plot_Delineation_media/image_c93a421b9c73.png)

Use **Copy as JSON** and save the contents as a text file alongside the
shapefile in the trial's `Plot_Layout` directory.

### Output

The shapefile produced by FIELDimageR contains plots identified only by
`fid`.

![Plots identified by fid in the shapefile attribute table](Plot_Delineation_media/image_6bacd8c6405f.png)

Attach trial metadata as described in
[Joining Trial Information](#joining-trial-information), then save the
final shapefile to the trial's `Plot_Layout` directory per the
[APPN Plot Shapefile Standard](#appn-plot-shapefile-standard).
