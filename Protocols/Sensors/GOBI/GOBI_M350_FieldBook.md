# APPN – GOBI M350 Fieldbook

For a high-level description of the GOBI sensor package and how it sits
alongside the other APPN platforms, see the
[Platforms Overview](../PlatformsOverview/Platforms_Overview.md).

For the GOBI fieldbook covering the Inspired Flight IF1200A, see
[GOBI IF1200 Fieldbook](../GOBI/GOBI_IF1200_FieldBook.md).

This fieldbook provides a standardised operational guide for APPN GOBI UAV
deployments **on the DJI M350**, supporting safe flight operations,
consistent sensor configuration, and high-integrity data capture. It is
intended for trained APPN staff conducting hyperspectral, LiDAR, RGB, and
GNSS-INS data acquisitions, and promotes repeatability, transparency, and
confidence in downstream data analysis across APPN operations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This protocol must be followed for all standard APPN GOBI M350 UAV
> flights.** Adherence to these procedures is essential to ensure operational
> safety, data integrity, and comparability of datasets across deployments.
> For any flights that **fall outside standard operating procedures**,
> detailed records must be kept documenting all deviations, including the
> specific settings changed, the rationale for those changes, and any
> anticipated implications for data quality or analysis.

## Flight Planning – DJI M350

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure that you apply for UAV flight approvals for locations and dates of
> flights well in advance.

1. Using a GPS survey system (Emlid, Trimble…) or GIS software, create a
   polygon of the area of interest with a 5-metre margin around the area of
   interest.
2. Using the GRYFN flight planning spreadsheet and DJI Pilot 2, set the
   parameters such as speed, overlap, and altitude. Orientation of the
   survey will be North–South in a paddock, or row-aligned for a plot trial.
3. Create two polygons: a *survey* polygon and a *capture* polygon. Ensure
   the *survey* polygon is 2× the flight speed larger than the *capture*
   polygon in the direction of travel (as per the figure below). Save both
   polygons uniquely.

   ![Survey vs capture polygon layout](GOBI_M350_FieldBook_media/image_154a62ad07f2.png)

4. If using QGIS, import the *capture* KML into Google Earth and immediately
   export it again. This is due to the required formatting Google Earth
   supplies.
5. Import the *capture* KML into the
   [HPI Polygon Tool](http://50.170.92.179/) and export. This polygon sets
   the activation of the hyperspectral sensor within Hyperspec3.
6. Import the *survey* polygon into DJI Pilot 2.
7. Using both DJI Pilot 2 and the GRYFN flight calculator, determine the
   speed, altitude, and frame period required to survey the area of interest.
8. Ensure the frame period is > 20% oversampled and the side overlap is > 30%.

---

## Pre-Flight

1. Conduct airspace and weather checks. If collecting hyperspectral data,
   collection time must be within ±2 hours of solar noon
   (refer: <https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/>).
2. *(Optional)* Set up the Emlid RTK (install a peg or permanent GCP below
   the base station for recurring flights), let it run for at least
   15 minutes, and start recording the RINEX file before flying.
3. Set up reflectance targets on the tables for calibration and validation.
   2 sets of GRYFN reflectance panels should be used if available, at
   alternate ends of the capture, with the validation panel located
   centrally. Make sure you have GCPs installed (and coordinates recorded
   using Emlid) in the field for geometric calibration. (TO DO: ADD STANDARD FLIGHT LAYOUT md)
4. Set up a safe UAV RTH location, RTH altitude, and other geo-fencing
   settings on the M350.
5. Attach payload (Gobi or CALViS) to the aircraft:
   - Connect the power cable from aircraft to payload (non-standard payload
     bus only).
   - Connect both GNSS antenna cables to the correct ports (match A1 and
     A2).
   - Remove RGB and Nano HP lens caps.
   - Insert RGB SD card.
   - Connect the C-type power cable to power the gimbal (make sure the B
     side of the cable is toward the outer side of the drone and the upper
     side of the light sensor).
   - Activate the battery-powered fan (if warm ambient conditions). Avoid
     leaving GOBI powered on in stagnant air or high heat (> ~35–38 °C).
6. Power on the radio controller; check battery status.
7. Launch DJI Pilot 2 on the M350.
8. Review the flight plan, checking operational height.
9. Power on the aircraft; confirm connection to RC and battery status.
10. Check that you are receiving GNSS RTK corrections. There should be more
    than 8 satellites for good correction (check the RTK fix in the M350
    controller settings).

## Sensor Configuration (TO DO: ADD DETAILS FROM CALVIS)

1. Place the exposure reference panel under the Nano HP lens; avoid casting
   shadows.
   - Place the drone legs upon exposure-angle cones, ensuring a fixed angle
     is achieved each exposure setting.
     **(angle provided through SIF excellence)**
2. Connect to GOBI Wi-Fi or connect the ethernet cable to the payload. Set
   a static IP address for the sensor at `10.0.65.2` (or anything other
   than `50`, `100`, and `128`, and must be less than `255`).
3. Navigate to the GOBI WebUI at `10.0.65.50`.
4. Ensure a valid elevation is achieved.
5. Name the mission, using the convention `YYYYMMDD_XXXX`
   (`YYYY` = year; `MM` = month; `DD` = day, must be 2 digits;
   `XXXX` = a short reference or abbreviation for the job).
6. Click **VNIR Setup**.
7. Open the Flight Calculator and update altitude/speed; adjust the
   oversampling buffer (must be at least 20%, recommended setting is 30%).
   **(value may change through hyperspectral excellence)**
8. Adjust exposure until ~95%
   **(value may change through hyperspectral excellence)** spectral
   saturation at the **peak of the 90th percentile line** without exceeding
   the frame period.
   - The maximum distance from the VNIR HS sensor to the GOBI reflectance
     panel is 40 cm. This is calculated based on the FOV and a 20 cm panel
     size.
9. Use the lowest gain mode that still provides sufficient saturation.
10. Import the polygon KML or text file.
11. Place the lens cap on the Nano HP.
12. Click **Collect Dark Reference**; remove the lens cap afterwards.
13. Remove the exposure reference panel.
14. Press **Start Mission**.
15. Remove the ethernet cable and begin flight operations.

## Flight Operations

1. Ensure the aircraft (M350) is in **Position** flight mode.
2. Sync the flight plan to the radio controller; double-check the flight
   plan.
3. Clear people/objects away from the UAV.
4. Notify crew/observers that takeoff is beginning.
5. Begin manual takeoff, check stick controls work, and then fly to ~12 m
   AGL; **do not exceed** the trigger altitude (20 m default) before
   mission start.
6. Perform dynamic alignment (one to two figure-8 patterns).
7. Enable autonomous mission.
8. Monitor UAV battery voltage/percentage in flight.
9. After mission, switch back to **Position** mode to regain manual
   control.
10. Lower to capture altitude and perform post-mission dynamic alignment
    (figure-8).
11. Land and disarm UAV.
12. Leave the UAV, transmitter, and sensor powered on; begin post-flight
    checks. Ensure data transfer is finished before turning off the sensor.
13. **Do not hot-swap the batteries.** Treat each flight as a new flight.

## Post-Flight Sensor Configuration

1. Reconnect to GOBI Wi-Fi or ethernet cable.
2. Open a browser to `10.0.65.50` or refresh the UI.
3. Press **Stop Mission**.
4. Replace the Nano HP and RGB lens caps.
5. Open WinSCP or equivalent and confirm the data.

## Post-Flight

1. Disconnect the ethernet cable from the payload.
2. Disconnect the aircraft batteries.
3. Disconnect the payload power cable.
4. Disconnect the payload GNSS cables.
5. Undo the mounting clamp, remove the payload, and place it in its case.
