# APPN – GOBI IF1200 Fieldbook

For a high-level description of the GOBI sensor package and how it sits
alongside the other APPN platforms, see the
[Platforms Overview](../PlatformsOverview/Platforms_Overview.md).

For the GOBI fieldbook covering the DJI M350, see
[GOBI M350 Fieldbook](../GOBI/GOBI_M350_FieldBook.md).

This fieldbook provides a standardised operational guide for APPN GOBI UAV
deployments **on the Inspired Flight IF1200A**, supporting safe flight
operations, consistent sensor configuration, and high-integrity data
capture. It is intended for trained APPN staff conducting hyperspectral,
LiDAR, RGB, and GNSS-INS data acquisitions, and promotes repeatability,
transparency, and confidence in downstream data analysis across APPN
operations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This protocol must be followed for all standard APPN GOBI IF1200 UAV
> flights.** Adherence to these procedures is essential to ensure operational
> safety, data integrity, and comparability of datasets across deployments.
> For any flights that **fall outside standard operating procedures**,
> detailed records must be kept documenting all deviations, including the
> specific settings changed, the rationale for those changes, and any
> anticipated implications for data quality or analysis.

## Flight Planning – Inspired Flight IF1200A

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure that you apply for UAV flight approvals for locations and dates of
> flights well in advance.

1. Using a GPS survey system (Emlid, Trimble…) or a GIS software, create a
   polygon of the area of interest. Make sure your polygon includes the areas
   where you will place your calibration panels and GCPs, with an additional
   5 m buffer to avoid incomplete data.
2. Save this polygon twice as a KML — once as a *survey* polygon and once as a
   *capture* polygon.
3. If using QGIS, export the polygon as a KML (in Geometry, select *include
   z-dimension*, and ensure the CRS is set to WGS 84). Import the *capture*
   KML into the [HPI Polygon Tool](http://50.170.92.179/) and export. This
   polygon sets the activation of the hyperspectral sensor within Hyperspec3.
4. Import the *survey* polygon into QGroundControl.
5. Using both QGroundControl and the GRYFN flight calculator, determine the
   speed, altitude, and frame period required to survey the area of interest.
   - Do not go below 2 m/s or above 8 m/s for stability reasons (GRYFN).
     Speeds greater than 8 m/s lead to excessive aircraft pitch and speeds
     less than 2 m/s accentuate the impacts of wind on aircraft stability and
     cause a visibly less smooth trajectory.
   - Altitude and speed will be tested and recommended from APEx results.
   - Ensure the frame period is at a minimum of 20% oversampling, the side
     overlap is > 40% for the SWIR sensor, and the *turnaround distance* is
     2× flight speed (> 3× at > 6 m/s).
6. Ensure flight lines are in the direction of planting (GRYFN).

## Pre-Flight

1. Conduct airspace and weather checks. If collecting hyperspectral data,
   collection time must be within ±2 hours of solar noon
   (refer: <https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/>).
2. *(Optional)* Set up the Emlid RTK (install a peg or permanent GCP below
   the base station for recurring flights), let it run for at least
   15 minutes, and start recording the RINEX file before flying.
3. Set up reflectance targets on the tables for calibration and validation.
   2 sets of GRYFN reflectance panels should be used if available, at
   alternate ends of the capture, with the validation panel located
   centrally. Make sure you have GCPs installed (and coordinates recorded
   using Emlid) in the field for geometric calibration. (TO DO: ADD STANDARD FLIGHT LAYOUT md)
4. Set up a safe UAV RTH location, RTH altitude, and other geo-fencing
   settings on the IF1200.
5. Attach payload (Gobi or CALViS) to the aircraft:
   - Connect the power cable from aircraft to payload (non-standard payload
     bus only).
   - Connect both GNSS antenna cables to the correct ports (match A1 and
     A2).
   - Remove RGB and Nano HP lens caps.
   - Insert RGB SD card.
6. Power on the radio controller; check battery status.
7. Launch QGroundControl on the IF1200 controller.
8. Review the flight plan, checking operational height.
9. Power on the aircraft; confirm connection to GCS and battery status;
   ensure Remote ID is enabled.
10. The IF1200 does not use RTK; ensure a minimum of 8 satellites and GPS
    lock before flying.
11. Upload the flight plan to the aircraft.

## Sensor Configuration (TO DO: ADD DETAILS FROM CALVIS)

1. Place the exposure reference panel under the Nano HP lens; avoid casting
   shadows.
   - Place the drone legs upon exposure-angle cones, ensuring a fixed angle
     is achieved each exposure setting.
     **(angle provided through SIF excellence)**
2. Connect to GOBI Wi-Fi or connect the ethernet cable to the payload. Set
   a static IP address for the sensor at `10.0.65.2` (or anything other
   than `50`, `100`, and `128`, and must be less than `255`).
3. Navigate to the GOBI WebUI at `10.0.65.50`.
4. Ensure a valid elevation is achieved.
5. Name the mission, using the convention `YYYYMMDD_XXXX`
   (`YYYY` = year; `MM` = month; `DD` = day, must be 2 digits;
   `XXXX` = a short reference or abbreviation for the job).
6. Click **VNIR Setup**.
7. Open the Flight Calculator and update altitude/speed; adjust the
   oversampling buffer (must be at least 20%, recommended setting is 30%).
   **(value may change through hyperspectral excellence)**
8. Adjust exposure until ~95%
   **(value may change through hyperspectral excellence)** spectral
   saturation at the **peak of the 90th percentile line** without exceeding
   the frame period.
   - The maximum distance from the VNIR HS sensor to the GOBI reflectance
     panel is 40 cm. This is calculated based on the FOV and a 20 cm panel
     size.
9. Use the lowest gain mode that still provides sufficient saturation.
10. Import the polygon KML or text file.
11. Place the lens cap on the Nano HP.
12. Click **Collect Dark Reference**; remove the lens cap afterwards.
13. Remove the exposure reference panel.
14. Press **Start Mission**.
15. Remove the ethernet cable and begin flight operations.

## Flight Operations

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: confirm IF1200-specific flight-mode terminology with operators
> (the original combined fieldbook only documented DJI M350 mode names).

1. Ensure the aircraft is in the appropriate manual / stable flight mode
   for the IF1200.
2. Sync / verify the flight plan in QGroundControl; double-check the flight
   plan.
3. Clear people/objects away from the UAV.
4. Notify crew/observers that takeoff is beginning.
5. Begin manual takeoff, check stick controls work, and then fly to ~12 m
   AGL; **do not exceed** the trigger altitude (20 m default) before
   mission start.
6. Perform dynamic alignment (one to two figure-8 patterns).
7. Enable autonomous mission.
8. Monitor UAV battery voltage/percentage in flight.
9. After mission, switch back to manual flight mode to regain manual
   control.
10. Lower to capture altitude and perform post-mission dynamic alignment
    (figure-8).
11. Land and disarm UAV.
12. Leave the UAV, transmitter, and sensor powered on; begin post-flight
    checks. Ensure data transfer is finished before turning off the sensor.
13. **Do not hot-swap the batteries.** Treat each flight as a new flight.
