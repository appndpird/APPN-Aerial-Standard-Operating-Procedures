## Standard Validation Flight – GOBI & CALViS

The standard validation flight consists of 5 flightlines over an area of
approximately 7,200 m² (60 m × 120 m). It can be flown over any safe and
convenient location, though it would ideally be flown over crops or grass
if available. The figure below shows how equipment should be placed in the
field.

- The default orientation should be North–South (as per the figure below)
  and flown as close as possible to solar noon.
- One GCP should be placed in each flightline in a diagonal pattern at
  10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% of the flightline (see figure). These will be
  positioned by taking a stroll along the flight lines with the UAV
  controller showing its live location.
- The first GRYFN 4× reflectance panel set should be placed in flightline 1
  ~30% of the way along the line (see figure).
  - This panel set will be used for ELM generation in the GRYFN Processing
    Tool.
  - This panel should be placed on the fold-out table levelled using the
    spirit bubble, and the approximate heights should be measured and
    recorded. This will be used to validate LiDAR and spectral
    characteristics.
  - Ensure that panels are set up in the following order:
    11%, 30%, 56%, 82% reflectance.

![Standard validation flight panel layout](Validation_Flight_media/image_d43bd2392053.jpg)

- The second panel should be placed at the centre of flightline 4, about
  30% from the start.
  - This is so one panel set is being captured in an alternative flight
    direction.
  - If a spectroradiometer is available, it should be set up above the
    panels on a continuous capture in the nadir configuration.
- The independent validation panel should be placed at the centre of
  flightline 3, 50% of the way along.

## IF1200 + CALViS or GOBI

1. Using QGroundControl, set up a new flight mission in a safe and
   convenient location. This can be over a field that needs surveying and
   is therefore useful for two purposes.
2. Create a rectangular survey area of approximately 6,200 m².
   1. Export the polygon and import it into the *HPI Polygon Tool*.
3. Use the parameters outlined below for flight planning in QGroundControl:

   | Parameter            | Setting                                |
   | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
   | Altitude             | 50 m                                   |
   | Flight speed         | 3.2 m/s                                |
   | Trigger Distance     | Leave as default (number is irrelevant)|
   | Spacing              | 12 m                                   |
   | Angle                | 180°                                   |
   | Turnaround Distance  | 10 m                                   |

4. Load this mission onto the IF1200.
5. **INSERT EXPOSURE SETTING PROCEDURE.**

## DJI M350 RTK + GOBI

1. Using DJI Pilot 2, set up a new flight mission in a safe and convenient
   location. This can be over a field that needs surveying and is therefore
   useful for two purposes.
2. Create a rectangular survey area of approximately 6,200 m².
3. Create a smaller rectangular survey which sits inside this larger
   *survey* area. This shapefile will be input to the GOBI to set the
   capture location.
   1. This polygon needs to be smaller by 2× the flight speed (~7 m) in the
      direction of the flight. The figure below outlines this — the red
      polygon is the *capture* polygon, the yellow is the *survey*
      polygon.

   ![Capture vs survey polygon](Validation_Flight_media/image_154a62ad07f2.png)

   2. Export the polygon and import it into the
      [HPI Polygon Tool](http://apps.headwallphotonics.com/).

4. Use the parameters outlined below for flight planning in DJI Pilot 2:

   | Parameter             | Setting |
   | --------------------- | ------- |
   | Altitude              | 50 m    |
   | Flight speed          | 3.2 m/s |
   | Side Overlap          | 49%     |
   | Frontal Overlap Ratio | 80%     |
   | Course Angle          | 180°    |
   | Margin                | 0       |
   | Elevation Optimisation| FALSE   |
